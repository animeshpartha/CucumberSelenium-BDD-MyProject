What is feature file in cucumber?
A Feature File is an entry point to the Cucumber tests. 
It is an essential part of Cucumber, as it serves as an automation test script as well as live documents. 
A feature file can contain a scenario or can contain 
many scenarios in a single feature file but it usually contains a list of scenarios.

Feature File consist of following components -

Feature: A feature would describe the current test script which has to be executed.

Scenario: Scenario describes the steps and expected outcome for a particular test case.

Scenario Outline: Same scenario can be executed for multiple sets of data using scenario outline. 
The data is provided by a tabular structure separated by (I I).

Given: It specifies the context of the text to be executed. 
By using datatables "Given", step can also be parameterized.

When: "When" specifies the test action that has to performed

Then: The expected outcome of the test can be represented by "Then"

What is "Step Definition"?
Step definition maps the Test Case Steps in the feature files(introduced by Given/When/Then) to code.

Summary:

-You need 2 Files – Features and Step Definition to execute a Cucmber test scenario

-Features file contain high level description of the Test Scenario in simple language

-Steps Definition file contains the actual code to execute the Test Scenario in the Features file.
